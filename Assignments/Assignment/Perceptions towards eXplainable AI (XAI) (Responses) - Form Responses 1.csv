According to my point of view, answers to some of the questions depend on the many factors such as context, stakeholders, impact/consequences, etc. For exmple, the needs of a ML practitioner, a manager who approves ML model deployment, and a user varies from one another. So ML practitioners would be interested in an explainations given from SHAP, LIME, whereas user may be interested in counterfactuals, or other verbal explanations.
